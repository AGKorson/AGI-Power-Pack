[
[ Power Pack v1.0 source code (for AGI version 2.411)
[
[ These modifications are possible because AGI doesn't validate the string 
[ number passed to set.string command, which means using values greater than 
[ max (24 for most versions) will overwrite memory in the game's data section, 
[ including the jump table for AGI commands. This makes it possible to 
[ redirect commands to the string array, where custom code can be easily 
[ injected. Using this to create a memory copy function, we can then gain 
[ complete access to the entire program memory segment. Meaning it's possible 
[ to modify existing AGI functionality, and create new functionality.
[
[ The mods and patches that are included in this power pack will:
[ 
[   - fix a bug in controller assignment function to allow all 49 
[     slots to be used, and add a clear controller function
[ 
[   - fix 'set.game.id' so it does not quit the game when id gets set
[
[   - modify the character printing functions to allow use of
[     extended characters in graphics and text modes, regardless of
[     color (this patch works in conjunction with the all-color patch
[     described below)
[
[   - modify 'clear.text.rect' and 'clear.lines' commands so that the
[     color that is passed is used, instead of just using black or
[     white; by passing negative values, the region is scrolled up 
[     instead of being cleared
[
[   - modify the color attributes and text printing functions so text
[     will print with any combination of foreground and background
[     colors on the graphics screen (this applies to all screen text
[     printing, including print/display commands, input line, and all
[     commands and internal functions that display text on screen 
[     regardless of screen mode and color choices)
[
[   - modify 'set.text.attributes' command to allow passing colors  
[     by variable
[
[   - modify 'set.text.attributes' command to allow "pushing" and 
[     "popping" the current attributes to make it easier to manage
[     color changes
[
[   - add a new function to allow setting message box colors 
[     (foreground, background and border) to any combination of 
[     colors
[
[   - modify 'graphics' and 'text.screen' commands to allow 
[     displaying eighty columns of text, in addition to the default 
[     forty column modes normally used by AGI; each mode can have 
[     column count set independently
[
[   - add a new 'auto-cycle' feature that will stop/start cycling
[     an object when it stops/starts moving, whether due to changing 
[     its direction value, or if it hits an obstacle
[
[   - modify the 'get.num' command so it ignores non-numeric key 
[     presses
[
[   - modify 'set.string' command to allow setting the input line
[     text programmatically
[
[   - modify 'set.string' command to allow changing the string 
[     compare function in the 'compare.strings' test command to 
[     binary (all characters match exactly), text (case is ignored 
[     but all other characters match exactly) or AGI (the default 
[     where case is ignored, and white space and several separator 
[     characters are ignored)
[
[   - add mouse support - if a mouse driver is loaded, cursor can be 
[     enabled/disabled for graphics mode (no mouse in text mode);
[     the cursor can also be customized, with different cursors
[     allowed in both 40 and 80 column mode; menus and save/restore
[     screens are automatically supported (click to highlight, 
[     double-click to select); inventory selection screen is also 
[     automatically supported (see below)
[
[   - fix input processing to ignore non-printable characters (for
[     example, if a control+key combo is not assigned to a
[     controller, AGI normally displays a control code symbol, which 
[     is always ignored by the parser)
[
[   - convert inventory screen to use graphics display; this reduces
[     the flicker that normally occurs when switching between text 
[     and graphics mode, and also allows the mouse to be used to
[     select objects
[
[   - modify 'set.cursor.char' command to allow designating a logic
[     to run as a custom status line; variables and flags can be 
[     designated as 'watch' to determine when to do an update
[ 
[   - provide 'click-to-move' support when the mouse is active; 
[     modify 'step.size' command to enable use of direct-line path
[     for movement, instead of agi default algorithm
[
[   - patch 'wander' command to correctly assign and countdown 
[     random movement length
[ 
[   - automatically detect presence of Sound Blaster or compatible
[     sound board to provide four-channel sound support in addition 
[     to the default PC speaker single channel mode 
[
[   - modify save/restore/restart to handle all power pack 
[     functionality (all features will persist in saved games)
[
[   - patch internal cursor functions to fix bug that draws an
[     unwanted blank space in certain situations (mostly when using
[     background colors other than black) and also a bug that 
[     incorrectly resets cursor after a 'get.string' command
[ 
[   - modify 'cycle.time' command to allow changing internal clock
[     to trigger 60 times a second, instead of 20; this allows for 
[     more precise control over movement and cycle timing
[
[   - add a countdown timer feature to help create accurate time 
[     triggered events and actions
[ 
[   - modify 'get.string' command to copy the current input line or 
[     the previous input line to a string
[ 
[   - enhance trace function to allow input and view/modify variables, 
[     flags and screen object information; display 'if', 'goto' and 
[     'return' commands, and also 'not', 'or', 'and' status (with the 
[     'T'/'F' result correctly reflecting 'not' status); fix  
[     formatting of trace window to right align logic number and to 
[     wrap commands and argument lists that exceed right margin; 
[     include argument type designators for clarity (v##, f##, c##, 
[     etc); include default word text in 'said' commands for clarity; 
[     fix bug in trace function that corrupts the current command 
[     pointer if a 'trace.on' command is encountered while tracing is 
[     active
[ 
[   - modify 'trace.info' function to allow full control of window 
[     placement (left/width in addition to built-in top/height)
[ 
[   - add string manipulation functions, including strLen, strCopy, 
[     strConcat, strLeft, strRight, strMid, strTrim, strInstr and 
[     strFormat, str2byte, hex2byte, byte2hex, strUpper, strLower
[
[   - patch parse command to allow parsing of all strings
[
[   - add new palette functions that allow changing the current 
[     palette, and also fading the screen in/out
[
[   - add new setmessage function that allows direct manipulation of 
[     message text, as well as support for dynamic menus
[
[   - add new setitem function to allow changing text of OBJECT file
[     inventory items
[
[   - add new itemcount function to get number of items at any 
[     location, including player inventory, in real time
[
[   - add new function that allows sending picture draw commands to  
[     to the screen after the picture is displayed
[
[   - add new function to get the priority and visual colors for any
[     coordinate location on the screen
[
[   - add set of functions to allow bitwise math (or, and, xor, 
[     bitshift)
[
[   - add functions to allow retrieval of current date/time
[
[   - add functions to allow creating data files and writing/reading 
[     string values
[
[   - add function that polls the shift, ctrl and alt keys, allowing
[     greater control over keyboard events
[
[   - add support for words to start with non-letters, and also for
[    words to contain extended characters
[
[   - add new test command to check if a coordinate is occupied by
[     a pixel of a given screen object
[
[   - add multiply and divide functions to early versions that do not
[     include those commands
[
[   - add new format option for message text that allows access to 
[     messages in any loaded logic resource
[
[   - move logic message text to a separate memory segment, freeing 
[     up heap memory for non-text resources
[
[   - add function to allow hiding all screen objects on the picture 
[     display
[
[   - add function to allow pausing the internal game clock while the
[     game is still running
[
[   - add functions to load and play sounds by variable, and also to
[     discard sounds
[
[ Detailed explanations of each power pack feature are included in its 
[ respective code block below, including syntax, limitations and 
[ considerations. Examples of all features are provided in the AGI Power Pack 
[ Demo game.

[ SET.STRING PATCH AND MEMCOPY FUNCTION
[ 
[ This patch is the first step in gaining access to power pack features. It 
[ modifies the set.string command so it can copy more than 40 characters and 
[ fixes the bug that adds an extra null character to the end of the string.

[ The next step is to modify the 'said' command so it will run a custom 
[ memory copy function that will be stored in s1. (The said command is used
[ because it accepts 16 bit unsigned integers, which makes it much easier to 
[ access memory addresses.) Also, retrieve current codepage, which is needed 
[ for extended character support.

[        - msgnum is the message number in this logic that the data

[        - tgtaddr is the target memory address where the data will be
[          copied to

[
[ CLEAR.CONTROLLER FUNCTION AND CONTROLLER TABLE BUGFIX
[
[ This patch creates a new function that allows you to clear a controller  
[ immediately instead of waiting for the next interpreter cycle. It also fixes
[ a bug in the set.key command. Although AGI allocates space to assign 49 
[ controllers, the bug limits the number of controllers that can actually be
[ assigned to 39. This patch adjusts the controller count to allow up to 49
[ assignments. 
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   [ to clear a controller from the eval table:
[   set.key(-1, -1, cNUM);
[ 
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: All 49 controller slots are now available, assign
[ as usual with the set.key command.
[
[ To clear a controller (meaning the controller() test command will no longer
[ return a value of TRUE), pass values of -1 (255) for the first two arguments.
[ This feature is useful when you have multiple blocks of code that respond to
[ a controller, but you only want one of them to run. Mouse clicks are one
[ particular situation where this is needed. See the AGI Power Pack Demo game 
[ for examples of how to use this feature.

[
[ SET.GAME.ID PATCH
[ 
[ This patch skips the check against the built-in gameID, allowing changes to  
[ the game ID with the 'set.game.id' command without causing AGI to quit.
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[  
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS:  The string assigned to gameID is limited to six 
[ characters, but can now include formatting codes (such as '%v1', '%s1', 
[ '%m1', etc). If you do use formatting codes, you should make sure the 
[ formatted string is six or less characters. (The patch uses a buffer of ~40 
[ characters when doing the conversion before truncating it to 6; if your 
[ formatted string exceeds that, it may result in crashing AGI.)
[
[ With the ID check removed, you can now change the ID multiple times during a 
[ game to give users access to more save game slots, because the save game 
[ files would have different names. So you could save by 'chapter', or allow 
[ users to choose an ID to sort their save game files.

[ EXTENDED CHARACTER SUPPORT PATCH
[
[ This patch fixes the graphics character display functions so that extended
[ characters (ascii values 128 - 254) will display properly just as they do in
[ the text mode.
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: DOS includes character glyphs for all ascii 
[ values except 255. Backspace, linefeed and carriage return (8, 10, 13) have
[ glyphs, but the internal print functions adjusts cursor position for these
[ values instead of printing the associated glyph.

[
[ CLEAR REGION COLOR/SCROLL PATCH
[
[ This patch modifies clear.lines and clear.text.rect so they use the actual
[ background color, instead of just black or white. By passing a negative 
[ value, the region is scrolled up (like the trace window) instead of being 
[ cleared.
[ 
[ SYNTAX:
[   clear.lines(TOP, BTM, COLOR*); 
[   clear.text.rect(R1, C1, R2, C2, COLOR*);
[
[   * COLOR argument can be any valid color (0-15), or a negative value
[     255(-1) to 128(-127); no other change from normal syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: This patch affects both graphics mode and 
[ text.screen mode. If COLOR is a valid color (0-15), the region is cleared to
[ that color. If COLOR is >=16 and <128, the actual color is only the lower 
[ nibble (i.e. COLOR(act) = COLOR bitOR 0Fh).
[
[ If COLOR is negative, the region is scrolled up n text rows, where
[ n = -COLOR. The exposed area of the region will be cleared to the current 
[ background color (set by last call to set.text.attributes). If n is greater
[ than the number of text rows in the region, the entire region is cleared to
[ the current background color. 
[
[ If the number of lines to scroll (n) is larger than the total number or rows  
[ in the region being scrolled, the entire region is scrolled. If the bottom  
[ value is less than the top value no scrolling is done.

[  FULL COLOR TEXT IN GRAPHICS MODE
[
[ This patch patch modifies the graphics text functions so all combinations 
[ of background and foreground color can be used (normal AGI functionality
[ only allows black-on-white, or any-color-on-black).
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The DOS interrupt functions necessary to make 
[ this patch work operate on a character-by-character basis; if you are 
[ printing or displaying an extremely large amount of text you may see a slight
[ delay as the characters are added. With smaller text amounts, the effect
[ is barely noticeable.
[
[ This patch allows for customization of the standard print window. That patch 
[ is provided below.

[ TEXT ATTRIBUTE UPGRADE
[
[ 'set.text.attribute' normally takes numbers as arguments; this patch uses
[ the toggle.monitor command as an 'initiator' command so the next call to 
[ set.text.attribute treats the arguments as variables. It automatically
[ returns set.text.attribute to normal afterward. Also, passing a value of -1 
[ as the foreground color will save the current colors, while passing a
[ value of -1 to background color will restore previously saved colors.
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   [ to pass colors by variable:
[   toggle.monitor();                [ initiator function
[   set.text.attribute(vFG*, vBG*);
[
[   [ to push current colors:
[   set.text.attribute(-1, any);
[
[   [ to pop stored colors into current:
[   set.text.attribute(any**, -1);
[
[   * The compiler expects numbers as arguments, not variables or messages, so
[     use the NUMBER of the variable or message, without the 'v' or 'm' prefix.
[
[  ** A value of -1 for FG will take precedence over a value of -1 for BG
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS:
[ - colors by variable: The toggle.monitor command is used to tell AGI that the
[   next call to set.text.attribute will use variables instead of numbers. 
[   (Since the Power Pack is only available on a PC with EGA monitor, the 
[   toggle.monitor command is free to re-purpose.) After setting colors by  
[   variable, set.text.attribute will automatically return to normal mode (i.e.
[   it will expect numbers again). This means when you wish to set colors by 
[   variable, you must use the toggle.monitor initiator every time.
[
[ - save/restore colors: The function does not use a 'stack'; only one color 
[   set is stored. This means multiple saves will overwrite previous saves. 
[   Restoring colors without saving first will get AGI default colors (BG = 0
[   and FG = 15), and restoring multiple times after a single push will get the
[   same colors.

[ 80 COLUMN TEXT SUPPORT
[
[ In both text and graphics mode, AGI uses a forty column-wide text screen to
[ display text. The EGA card is capable of displaying eighty columns in both 
[ modes without affecting the display of graphics elements. This patch creates 
[ a new function that allows you to set the column count for either mode to 
[ eighty or forty. The function is accessed by passing a value of -1 to the 
[ configure.screen command. 
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   configure.screen(-1, MODE*, COL**);
[   
[   * if MODE is 0, the graphics mode column count will be adjusted; any other 
[     value will modify the text mode
[
[  ** if COL is 0, 40 column mode is set; any other value will set 80 column
[     mode
[
[ LIMITATION/CONSIDERATIONS: The main benefit of using 80 columns (in both 
[ modes) is that it allows you to include more verbose messages and text. For 
[ example, the Help screen is severely limited with only 40 columns; with 80 
[ columns you can include a lot more useful information. In 80 column mode, 
[ you can have a much larger menu system.
[
[ In 80 column mode, normal print messages will use the same default text 
[ width (30) as in 40 column mode. If you want message boxes to be wider than
[ that, you have to use the print.at command.
[
[ If you intend to use a wider menu in 80 column mode, be sure to set the mode 
[ BEFORE setting up your menu. If you have a menu that extends past 40 columns,
[ do not try to display it in 40 column mode; it will not display correctly.
[
[ Normally, you will set the column count once during startup of a game and
[ leave it. But the patch fully supports swapping column count at any time 
[ while a game is running, if you need that functionality in your game.
[ 
[ If you do intend to switch between modes during your game, you will need to
[ manually track which column count is currently active (a flag works for 
[ this) and check margins as needed; using widths greater than 40 in 40 
[ column mode will cause your displayed text to spill over to the next line.
[ 
[ The function will automatically refresh the screen (by calling graphics or 
[ text.screen command) after setting the new column count. This will redraw 
[ the graphics screen or clear the text screen respectively.

[   set.upper.left(oNUM*, vMODE**);
[
[   * The compiler expects numbers as arguments, not objects, so use the 
[     NUMBER of the object, without the 'o' prefix.
[
[  ** if value of vMODE is 0, auto-cycling is disabled (normal AGI behavior)
[     if value of vMODE is any non-zero value, auto-cycling is ENABLED
[     Pass vMODE as a number, without the 'v' prefix.
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The set.upper.left command is a null function
[ in AGI so it can be re-purposed. 
[
[ The auto-cycle property overrides all other cycling modes. If you want a 
[ stationary object to cycle (by using end.of.loop or any other cycling mode) 
[ you must first disable the auto-cycle property.
[
[ This patch also fixes two minor bugs: one with blocks - when movement is 
[ stopped due to hitting a block, AGI won't update the object's loop based on 
[ direction, like it does with hitting other objects or control lines. This 
[ patch fixes that.
[
[ The object collision check has a bug in it that uses the wrong  value when 
[ comparing object left/right edges; this prevents objects from being next to 
[ one another (the bug causes objects to need an extra pixel between them).
[ This patch fixes that so objects can correctly be right up next to another
[ object without causing a position error.

[ SET INPUT AND STRING COMPARE FEATURES
[
[ This patch modifies set.string to provide two new features - you can send 
[ text directly to the input line (replacing what the user has currently 
[ typed there), and you can adjust the compare mode used by the 
[ 'compare.strings' test command to binary, text or AGI (default).
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   [ to set the input line:
[   set.string(s255, mInput);
[
[   [ to change string compare mode:
[   set.string(s254, MODE*);
[
[   * The compiler expects the second argument to be a message number so pass 
[     MODE as m0, m1 or m2.
[         MODE = 0: restore normal AGI comparison
[         MODE = 1: text compare (case insensitive)
[         MODE = 2: binary compare (case sensitive)
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The message used to set the input line can 
[ contain formatting codes such as '%v', '%s' and so on. If the formatted 
[ length of the message is greater than 38, it will get truncated to 38. If 
[ there is already text on the input line, it is completely replaced by the
[ new text.
[
[ The default AGI string compare mode is to ignore case, and most non-
[ alphanumeric characters (See the WinAGI Help file for details on normal
[ AGI string comparison). Use a value of 0 for MODE to reset the default  
[ AGI mode.
[
[ The new 'text' compare mode will ignore case, but all other characters, 
[ including those that the default mode ignores must match for the test to 
[ return true.
[
[ With the new 'binary' compare mode, all characters must match exactly, 
[ including case, for the test to return true.
[
[ This version has a bug in string compare function that incorrectly returns 
[ TRUE if the second string is longer than the first, and characters up to the 
[ length of the first string are a match. This patch fixes that bug.
[
[ This patch also fixes a buffer overflow bug in the compare function if either 
[ string exceeds forty characters. Strings longer than forty characters are 
[ now truncated before being compared.

[ MOUSE SUPPORT
[
[ This patch adds support for mouse by replacing some of the joystick code. 
[ The patch will automatically detect a mouse driver, and if one is found, the
[ mouse functions are available for use. The patch provides access to mouse
[ position and button status by assigning three new reserved variables. Right 
[ and left button click and double-click events are supported. Mouse support 
[ for menus is also provided. Custom cursors can easily be loaded as needed.
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   [ to enable (show) mouse:
[   enable.item(c255);
[
[   [ to disable (hide) mouse:
[   disable.item(c255);
[
[   [ to load a cursor:
[   set.key(BYVAR, mCURSOR*, c255);
[
[   [ to change mouse variables:
[   block(-3, XVAR, YVAR, BVAR);
[
[   * The compiler expects the second argument to be a number so pass 
[     mCURSOR as a number without the 'm' prefix.
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The mouse patch uses several joystick elements,
[ so the joystick is not available, even if it's connected. The init.joystick
[ command is set to a null function to avoid potential conflicts.
[
[ The patch first checks for a mouse, and sets reserved flag f8 
[ (enableDblClick) if found. If no mouse is detected, the flag is reset.
[ If a mouse driver is not found, calls to 'enable mouse' are ignored, and the
[ game will continue to run normally, just without mouse support. Calls to 
[ 'disable mouse' when the mouse is already disabled are also ignored.
[ 
[ When enabled, variables v27, v28 and v29 are the default reserved variables  
[ for mouse-X, mouse-Y and mouse-Btn respectively. You can change the 
[ variables that store mouse information by using the block command with -3 as
[ the first argument. XVAR will be the number of the new mouse-X, YVAR the new 
[ mouse-Y, and BVAR the new mouse-Btn. The mouse variables are updated 
[ continuously. To determine current mouse position, just check mouse-X and 
[ mouse-Y variables. Mouse button status will be:
[    0 if no button pressed
[    1 if left button is pressed
[    2 if right button is pressed
[    3 if both buttons are pressed
[
[ Similar to the joystick, a left click will send an 'ENTER' key press and 
[ right click will send an 'ESCAPE' key press when a message box is visible. 
[
[ Mouse click and double-click events replace joystick button events. To use 
[ these events, assign controllers using set.key command as follows:
[   1, 1 = mouse left button click
[   1, 2 = mouse right button click
[   1, 3 = mouse left button double-click
[   1, 4 = mouse right button double-click
[
[ Mouse double-click is enabled by default if a mouse is detected (reserved 
[ flag f8 is set). Reset flag f8 to ignore double-clicks. Double-click speed  
[ can be controlled by setting reserved variable v15 (dblClickDelay). 
[ 
[ When the mouse is disabled (hidden), no mouse events will occur, and the 
[ mouse variables will NOT update. If text mode is set while the mouse is 
[ enabled the mouse is temporarily hidden. Button events will still activate
[ and BVAR will updated, but mouse position (XVAR and YVAR) will not. Switching
[ back to graphics mode will re-enable the mouse.
[
[ When the cursor is visible, support for menus is automatically enabled, but 
[ you must still call menu.input() to actually show the menu (usually by 
[ testing for a left mouse click on the top text row of the screen). Clicking 
[ a menu will select it. Clicking a menu item will highlight that item (if it
[ is enabled). Double-click an item to select it. Right-click anywhere to close
[ the menu without making a selection.
[
[ To change the mouse cursor, use the set.key command, passing -1 for the first
[ and second arguments, and a message (using the 'c' prefix instead of 'm') as
[ the third argument. The cursor string must be exactly 132 characters, 
[ comprised of 66 two-digit hex values. The first two digits are the 
[ column (x) offset of the cursor hotspot, the next two are the row (y) offset.
[ The remaining 128 digits are the screen and cursor masks. For details on how
[ to define a cursor, see the examples in the Power Pack Demo game.

[ INVENTORY SCREEN PATCH
[ 
[ The inventory screen uses the text mode, but it doesn't have to. This patch 
[ changes it to use the graphics mode, which reduces flicker, and also allows 
[ the mouse to be used. You can highlight items by clicking them, and select 
[ them by double-clicking. Right-clicking will dismiss the screen, same as 
[ escape.
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The graphics mode uses a slightly different font
[ than the text mode, but it is barely noticeable. This is a property of DOS
[ and cannot be modified. 
[
[ If the mouse is enabled and item selection is enabled (calling status command
[ with flag f13 set to TRUE), you can click on an item to highlight it. 
[ Double-click an item to select it.
[
[ This patch also fixes a bug that misplaces the input line when switching to
[ text mode. (It is rare to allow input in text mode, but if you want to, the
[ input line will now be correctly positioned.)

[
[ CUSTOM STATUS LINE
[
[ This patch allows you to designate a logic that will run in place of the 
[ built in status line update code. The logic will run when ever variables or 
[ flags that you choose change their value. Use the set.cursor.char function to
[ enable or disable the custom status line.
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   [ to enable or modify custom status line parameters:
[   set.cursor.char(" lNUM, vA, vB, vC, vD, vE, fA, fB, fC, fD, fE"); 
[   
[   [ to disable the custom status line:
[   set.cursor.char(" ");
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS:
[ To enable the custom status line, the message passed to set.cursor.char must 
[ begin with a space (chosen because it doesn't have any practical value as a 
[ real cursor character). The rest of the message indicates what logic to run 
[ (prefix 'l' then number), and up to five variables and/or five flags that, 
[ when changed, will cause the logic to run. The parameters don't need to be 
[ separated, but you can include spaces and punctuation to improve readability.
[ Note that you cannot use define values; you must use 'v##' and 'f##' format.
[
[ If you don't designate a logic to run, or if you pass a single space 
[ character, the custom status line will be disabled instead.
[
[ Once enabled, you can hide/display the custom status line the same as the 
[ built-in line, using status.line.on and status.line.off commands.
[
[ During the main game cycle, if any of your designated variables or flags have
[ changed value, AGI will run your designated logic. (This approach means 
[ your status line doesn't update in each cycle; only when there's a change 
[ that matters. This reduces screen flicker.) The logic can be as simple or 
[ as complicated as you wish. See the Power Pack Demo game for some examples 
[ of custom status lines. 
[
[ When the custom status line is disabled, the built-in status line 
[ functionality is automatically restored.

[ POINT AND CLICK MOVEMENT
[
[ When the mouse is enabled, point-and-click movement control for ego is 
[ provided automatically. Two path calculation modes are supported - the 
[ default AGI mode (move diagonally then horizontal/vertical) or a direct line 
[ mode.
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   [ to enable point-and-click:
[   set(f17);
[
[   [ to disable point-and-click:
[   reset(f17);
[
[   [ to change path mode:
[   step.size(ego, vMODE*);
[
[   [ to stop ego during point-and-click movement:
[   vDIR = 0;
[   set.dir(ego, vDIR); 
[ 
[   * use a value of -1 for vMODE to set direct line mode;
[     use a value of -2 for vMODE to set the default AGI mode
[
[   **you can use any variable for vMODE or vDIR
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: Flag f17 is designated reserved with this patch. 
[ You can't use that flag for anything else.
[
[ The AGI default path mode will move ego diagonally until it is horizontally
[ or vertically aligned with the target location. You can switch to the direct 
[ line mode by using the step.size command on ego with a value of -1. To reset 
[ back to AGI default mode use a value of -2.
[ 
[ Pressing a direction key while ego is moving will override the point-and-
[ click motion. Normally, set.dir can't be used to control ego direction, but 
[ you can programmatically cancel point-and-click movement by using set.dir
[ command on ego as indicated. 
[
[ When canceled, ego will continue to move in the last calculated direction. 
[ If you want to cancel point-and-click movement and stop ego at the same time, 
[ use egodir (v6) as vDIR.
[ 
[ Do not set egodir to any other value while a point-and-click movement is in
[ progress. It will cause ego to move off the calculated path for one cycle 
[ which will prevent ego from reaching the clicked destination.
[
[ See the Power Pack Demo game for examples of how to program point-and-click
[ movement.

[ WANDER COMMAND BUG FIX
[
[ The wander command appears to have a minor bug in it. When the distance 
[ counter reaches zero, a new direction is chosen randomly, but the counter 
[ gets set to 255, instead of choosing a new counter. A new counter is only 
[ chosen if the object stops (due to hitting an obstacle) AND the current 
[ counter is less than six. The effect of this bug is that objects tend to go 
[ in straight lines much further than the desired maximum of 51, and mostly 
[ change direction only when hitting an obstacle. This is usually not 
[ noticeable, because most rooms don't have that much space available for 
[ objects to wander. This patch fixes that bug, so objects will choose a new 
[ distance counter between 6 and 51 any time a new direction is chosen, as it 
[ appears that was the original intent. 
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[ 
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: If you would rather use the original algorithm 
[ for wandering, just comment out this patch.

[
[ FOUR CHANNEL SOUND
[  
[ The PC version of AGI will only play single channel sound through the PC 
[ speaker. This patch will automatically check for a Sound Blaster (or 
[ compatible) FM synthesizer sound board and enable all three sound channels if
[ one is present. The noise channel is also supported.
[ It will also detect the presence of a general MIDI device (such as a Roland)
[ and allow playback of sounds as MIDI music.
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   [ to enable four channel sound:
[   set(f18);
[   [ to disable four channel sound:
[   reset(f18);
[
[   [ to switch between FM synthesizer and MIDI:
[   set.key(MODE, ANY**, c254);
[
[   [ to change channel envelopes (instruments):
[   set.key(vCHANNEL*, vINSTRUMENT*, c253);
[
[   [ to set a custom envelope for a sound channel:
[   set.key(vCHANNEL*, vENVDATAMSG*, c252);
[
[   * The compiler expects this argument to be a number so pass the 
[     variable as a number without the 'v' prefix
[
[  ** This argument is ignored, so it can be any value
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: Flag f18 is reserved for use by this patch to 
[ control number of sound channels. It should not be used for anything else. 
[
[ The patch checks for both types of sound card- FM synthesizer and MIDI 
[ playback device. If one or both are found, four channel sound will be 
[ available. If neither sound card is detected, the patch will play single 
[ channel sound only, regardless of the value of f18.
[
[ The patch sets reserved variable v22 when it runs as follows: 
[      1: no sound boards/devices detected
[      2: FM synth sound board only detected
[      3: MIDI device only detected
[      4: Both FM synth and MIDI devices detected.
[ You can check this variable to know what sound capabilities are available. 
[
[ In addition to playing all sound channels, volume control is also supported 
[ (unlike the normal PC mode which ignores volume information). Individual 
[ notes in a sound file are limited to a four-bit (0-15) volume value, but 
[ since the sound card uses six bits, values for the master volume level 
[ (reserved variable v23) can be from 0 (no attenuation, maximum volume) to 
[ 63 (maximum attenuation, muted sound). This gives you much finer control 
[ over the volume of sounds being played.
[
[ The default mode is FM synth. To change the mode, pass a variable with value 
[ of 1 (for MIDI mode) or 0 (for FM Synth mode) to set.key with c254 as the  
[ controller argument.
[
[ In FM synthesis mode, the sounds are generated by the sound card's frequency
[ modulation (FM) chip. You can program 'instruments' by changing a channel's
[ envelope registers. The default envelope for the FM music channels is the 
[ one provided in the original AGISB hack by Anders M. Olsson (AGISB). The 
[ noisechannel FM defaults (both tone and white noise) are best estimates to 
[ match original AGI sound.
[
[ A set of 127 additional 'instruments' that roughly correspond to standard 
[ MIDI instruments is also included. You can change the instrument for each 
[ channel independently by passing the instrument number (0-127 for standard 
[ MIDI instruments, 128 for default music channels, 129 for default white 
[ noise and 130 for default tone) to the set.key command with c253 as the 
[ controller argument. For the noise channels use a channel value of 3 to 
[ change the white noise instrument, and 4 to change the tone instrument. See 
[ the Power Pack demo game for a complete list of all 128 instruments that are 
[ available.
[ 
[ Keep in mind that the sound is generated by an FM chip, not using sampled 
[ sounds such as in MIDI sound boards. So the results aren't going to sound 
[ much like their MIDI counterparts. But through experimentation, you can find 
[ instrument values that do provide for very nice playback of sounds, with 
[ lots of variety.
[ 
[ You can also set the envelope data to a custom value by passing a message 
[ (by variable) that contains 11 2-digit byte codes to the set.key command 
[ with c252 as the controller argument. You need to have a good understanding 
[ of FM chip details if you plan to use this option. See the Power Pack demo 
[ game for additional information on how to use this option, and for links to 
[ some resources for working with sound card FM chips.
[
[ In MIDI mode, instruments can be changed as well, but only for the three 
[ tone tracks. The noise track is preset to a percussion instrument. 
[ You cannot customize instruments when in MIDI mode. Only instruments 0-127 
[ available in MIDI mode.
[
[ Separate instrument settings are maintained for each mode.

[ SAVE/RESTORE/RESTART SUPPORT
[
[ This patch provides support for save/restore/restart functions for all of 
[ the patches in this power pack. 
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: Games that are saved by the power pack include a 
[ version marker that ensures restored games are compatible with the AGI 
[ version and power pack version they were saved from. If you try to restore a
[ game from the wrong version, AGI will raise an error and quit. 
[
[ The patch restores the status bar state (normal AGI doesn't). It also fixes 
[ a bug that didn't correctly reload a trace logic, if one was loaded when the 
[ game was saved.
[
[ After a restart, the interpreter version (as an index value, i.e. 1 = v2.089,
[ 2 = 2.272, etc.) is returned in v19 (errorParameter) in case your code needs
[ to know. For this interpreter version, the index value is:
[
[   version 2.411 --> index == 3

[ MAIN CYCLE TIMING TURBO MODE & TIMER FUNCTIONS
[
[ AGI uses a custom timing interrupt to manage the internal game clock that 
[ controls sound timing as well as the main interpreter loop timing. The timer
[ interrupt runs 60 times a second (which is why sound resources use a 'tick' 
[ length of 1/60 sec). The main loop timer uses three of the main timer ticks
[ for each game cycle (which is why animation intervals are measured in 1/20  
[ sec ticks). This patch changes the game timer to fire at the same frequency 
[ as the main timer (60 times per second). The patch also adds a delay function
[ that can be used to create accurate delay times during logic execution, and 
[ a countdown timer function to easily add highly accurate timer features.
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   [ to change game loop base interval (20 cps/60 cps)
[   cycle.time(o255, vMODE*);
[
[   [ to set a delay time
[   cycle.time(o254, vDELAY**);
[
[   [ to create a countdown timer
[   block(-29, vMINUTES***, vSECONDS***, fDONE***);
[
[   [ to stop/restart a timer
[   block(-30, STATE, ANY****, ANY****);
[
[    * set value of vMODE to 1 to set game cycle speed to 'turbo' mode;
[      set value of vMODE to 0 to restore normal game cycle speed
[
[   ** value of vDELAY is number of milliseconds to delay before processing  
[      the next command
[
[  *** The compiler expects numbers for all arguments so pass variables and 
[      flags as numbers, without the 'v' or 'f' prefix
[
[ **** This argument is ignored, so it can be any value
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The turbo mode runs game cycles three times 
[ faster than normal. So if animationInterval (v10) is 1 in normal mode, 
[ setting it to 3 in turbo mode will give the same game speed. 
[
[ With the faster cycle time, you can have much finer control over animation 
[ and movement timing. See the Power Pack Demo game for a demonstration of 
[ this.
[
[ To create a delay time, set vDELAY to the desired number of milliseconds. 
[ (For delays longer than 255 ms, use multiple calls to the delay function.)  
[ This function is very accurate, within a few microseconds on most PCs 
[ (including DOSBox). Besides being more accurate, it is much simpler to 
[ program in AGI; one command can now take the place of complicated loop  
[ structures that try to create delays by counting down variables or comparing
[ time against the game clock.
[
[ Use the block command, with -28 for the first argument to start a countdown
[ timer. The variables, vMINUTES and vSECONDS should be set to the desired
[ countdown value. Once the countdown starts, these variables will be updated 
[ in real time by the main timer interrupt. Once the timer hits zero, fDONE 
[ will be set to TRUE. If you alter the input variables after the countodwn 
[ starts, the timer will continue the countdown with the newly revised values.
[
[ To pause a running timer, use the block command with -29 as the first 
[ argument. If STATE = 0, the timer is paused. If STATE = 1 (or any other 
[ value) a paused timer will restart.

[ TRACE FUNCTION ENHANCEMENTS
[
[ AGI's trace mode let's you step through logic commands, but the display is 
[ rudimentary, and there are no debugging options while trace mode is active.
[ This patch significantly enhances the the trace mode, including:
[
[ - changes the trace mode toggle key from ScrollLock to CTRL+BACKSPACE
[ - enables text input, ego direction changes and controller activations
[ - view and change variable and flag values while trace window is active
[ - 'return', 'goto' and 'if' statements are displayed as commands
[ - test commands include 'not' (!), 'or' (||) and 'and' (&&) symbols
[ - the result column shows correct value if the test is 'not'ed
[ - false results are displayed in red
[ - arguments include prefixes ('v', 'f', 'm', etc)
[ - said commands use default word text instead of numbers
[ - commands/arguments that extend past right margin are word-wrapped
[ - the window left and width properties can be set
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   [ to change trace window left/width
[   trace.info(0, LEFT, WIDTH);
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: This patch changes the key press to toggle the 
[ trace mode from the ScrollLock button to CTRL+BACKSPACE, since many modern 
[ keyboards no longer include the ScrollLock button. 
[ 
[ When the trace window is active, you can press the INSERT key to temporarily
[ enable input. Press INSERT again to return to normal trace mode. When this 
[ feature is activated, key presses are put on the input line (if it is 
[ active). If the key press is a controller, then the controller is activated. 
[ Ego direction keys are also processed (unless ego is in program control 
[ mode). Each time you enable input, reserved flag f2 (haveInput) is reset in 
[ order to allow subsequent said commands to match. You do have to press the
[ ENTER key to have AGI parse the input and set f2 to TRUE. If you activate
[ the input mode again, it will reset f2 again, so your previously entered 
[ input will now be ignored. (TIP: if you are going to do multiple inputs 
[ (controllers and ego direction), do those before entering text input.)
[
[ You can also view flags and variables while tracing by pressing CTRL+F and 
[ CTRL+V. After entering the flag/variable number, the value is then displayed.
[ You can edit the value, pressing ENTER to save the new value. Pressing ENTER
[ without editing the value (or pressing ESCAPE) will leave the value 
[ unchanged. For flags, a value of 'T' or 't' or any non-zero number will set 
[ the flag, all other values will reset the flag.
[
[ Pressing CTRL+O will allow you to view screen object parameters (the same as 
[ the obj.status.v command). 
[
[ Making the trace window too small will crowd the display. The 80 column mode
[ works best for tracing, because you can move the window to keep areas of 
[ interest uncovered.
[
[ Just as with print.at settings, don't use a LEFT value less than 2 or a 
[ WIDTH value that results in a right margin (LEFT + WIDTH - 1) greater than 
[ 37 (or 77 in 80 column mode), or the trace window will not draw correctly. 
[
[ This patch also fixes a bug in the trace function that corrupts the running 
[ logic if a trace.on command is encountered while trace function is active.

[ GET INPUT LINE
[ 
[ This patch modifies the get.string command to allow retrieval of the current 
[ input line, as well as the most recently entered input.
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   [ to get current input line
[   get.string(sA, mANY*, -1, ANY*, ANY*);
[
[   [ to get previous input line
[   get.string(sA, mANY*, -2, ANY*, ANY*);
[
[   * These arguments are ignored, so they can be any value
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: String sA is replaced with the current or 
[ previous input line. If sA is not valid (i.e.greater than the maximum 
[ allowed string value), the command is ignored.
[
[ The current input line means everything the player has currently typed for 
[ input, exactly as it is, no cleaning up like what parsing does. The previous 
[ input line means what was on the input line the last time the player pressed 
[ ENTER (also as-is, no clean up).

[ STRING FUNCTIONS
[
[ Strings aren't very useful in AGI because there are no commands that let you
[ manipulate them. This patch provides 16 basic string functions.
[
[ SYNTAX*:
[   [ strLen
[   block(-4, sINPUT, vRESULT, ANY**); 
[
[   [ strCopy
[   block(-5, sFROM, sTO, ANY**);
[
[   [ strConcat
[   block(-6, sINPUT, sADD, ANY**);
[
[   [ sLeft
[   block(-7, sINPUT, sRESULT, vLEN);
[
[   [ sRight
[   block(-8, sINPUT, sRESULT, vLEN);
[
[   [ sMid
[   block(-9, sINPUT, vPOS, vLEN);
[
[   [ strTrim
[   block(-10, sINPUT, sRESULT, vMODE);
[
[   [ sInstr
[   block(-11, sINPUT, vCHAR, vPOS);
[
[   [ sFormat
[   block(-12, sINPUT, sRESULT, ANY**);
[
[   [ str2byte
[   block(-13, sINPUT, vRESULT, ANY**);
[
[   [ hex2byte
[   block(-14, sINPUT, vRESULT, ANY**);
[
[   [ byte2Hex
[   block(-15, sRESULT, vINPUT, ANY**); 
[
[   [ strUpper
[   block(-16, sINPUT, sRESULT, ANY**);
[
[   [ strLower
[   block(-17, sINPUT, sRESULT, ANY**);
[
[   [ Byte2Char
[   block(-18, sRESULT, vCHAR, ANY**); 
[
[   [ Char2Byte
[   block(-19, vRESULT, sIN, ANY**); 
[
[   [ set.string.v
[   block(-20, vSTR, vMSG, ANY**);
[
[    * The compiler expects numbers for all arguments so pass strings and 
[      variables as numbers, without the 's' or 'v' prefix
[
[   ** This argument is ignored, so it can be any value
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: These functions all use the block command. To
[ access them, use the correct function identifier for the first argument.
[ If you pass an invalid string value to any of these functions, the function 
[ will exit without making any changes.
[
[ Details on usage of each function are provided below:
[
[   strLen - The length of sINPUT is returned in variable vRESULT.
[
[   strCopy - sINPUT is copied to sRESULT. No change is made to sINPUT.
[
[   strConCat - sADD is added to the end of sINPUT. sADD is not affected.  
[   sADD can be the same as sINPUT, in which case sINPUT will be doubled 
[   up.
[
[   sLeft - n characters (where n = value of vLEN) are copied from the left
[   of sINPUT into sRESULT. If vLEN is greater than the length of sINPUT
[   all of sINPUT is copied.
[
[   sRight - n characters (where n = value of vLEN) are copied from the 
[   right of sINPUT into sRESULT. If vLEN is greater than the length of 
[   sINPUT all of sINPUT is copied.
[
[   sMid - **This function modifies sINPUT, instead of putting the result
[   in a different string.**
[   n characters (where n = value of vLEN) are copied from sINPUT,
[   starting at character p (where p = value of vPOS). Position values 
[   are zero-based (meaning first character is 0, last character is
[   length-1). If vPOS is >= length of sINPUT, a null string is returned.
[   
[   strTrim - sINPUT is copied to sRESULT, with leading and/or trailing 
[   spaces removed. Pass mode by variable. Four modes are supported:
[   mode = 0: full trim, both right and left
[   mode = 1: only leading spaces are removed (ltrim)
[   mode = 2: only trailing spaces are removed (rtrim)
[   mode = 3: the string is 'cleaned' using the same function AGI uses 
[             when parsing the input line (see WinAGI Help file for
[             details on how input is 'cleaned')
[
[  strInstr - Starting at character p (where p = value of vPOS) variable
[  vPOS is set to the position of the next instance of character c
[  (where c = value of vCHAR) in sINPUT. Position values are zero-based 
[  (meaning first character is 0, last character is length-1). If the
[  character is not found, the returned value is 255. If vPOS is >=
[  length of sINPUT, the returned value is 255. 
[
[  strFormat - sINPUT is formatted and then copied to sRESULT. Formatting 
[  means print format codes (%v, %s, %m, etc) are replaced with their 
[  respective values. sRESULT can be the same as sINPUT.
[
[  str2byte: sINPUT is converted to a numerical value, and returned in 
[  vRESULT. Numerical digits are processed until the end of the string is 
[  reached, or a non-numerical character is encountered. If the value is 
[  greater than 255, the result is value MOD 256.
[
[  hex2byte: the first two bytes of sINPUT are converted from hexadecimal
[  to a numerical value; the result is stored in vRESULT. If any characters
[  in sINPUT are not valid hex numbers (0-9, a-f or A-F), they are treated
[  as zeros. 
[
[  byte2hex: vINPUT is converted to a two-digit hex string and stored in
[  sRESULT.
[
[  strUpper: sINPUT is copied to sRESULT and then converted to upper case.
[  sRESULT can be the same as sINPUT.
[
[  strLower: sINPUT is copied to sRESULT and then converted to lower case.
[  sRESULT can be the same as sINPUT.
[ 
[  byte2char: sRESULT is set to the ascii character of vCHAR.
[
[  char2byte: vRESULT is set to the ascii value of the first character in sIN
[
[  set.string.v: message mB is assigned to string sA, where B is the value 
[  of vMSG and A is the value of vSTR.
[
[ This patch also fixes a bug that limits the number of strings that can be
[ parsed. Now all strings can be parsed.

[ PALETTE FUNCTIONS
[
[ This patch creates custom functions that allow you to change the display 
[ color palette. It also includes functions that will fade the screen to/from 
[ fully black or fully white that are useful for creating transitions when 
[ changing rooms.
[
[ SYNTAX: 
[   [ to change the palette
[   block(-21, BYVAR, PALETTE, LOADONLY);
[
[   [ to fade screen in from blank 
[   block(-22, BYVAR, DELAY, COLOR); 
[
[   [ to fade screen out to blank
[   block(-23, BYVAR, DELAY, COLOR);
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: To change the current display palette, use the 
[ block command with -19 as the first argument. PALETTE is a message that 
[ contains hexadecimal values of the new colors. Format characters (%s, %v, 
[ %m, etc) are allowed. The formatted string must be exactly 96 characters, 
[ representing 48 two-digit hex values - three hex values (in the form of 
[ RRGGBB) for each of the sixteen colors. Do not use spaces or any other 
[ characters. If non-hex characters are passed, they will be treated as zeros. 
[ Passing a string that is not exactly 96 characters long will be ignored (the 
[ function will not change the palette). 
[
[ The LOADONLY argument should normally be set to 0. If you want to change 
[ palettes between fade actions (fade out with one palette, then fade in with 
[ a different palette), you can use a value of 1 for LOADONLY to load the 
[ palette without forcing an immediate change.
[
[ The fade commands do not change the stored palette information. They will 
[ use the current palette settings, and gradually darken the screen to black 
[ (if COLOR is 0) or gradually brighten the screen to full white (if COLOR is 
[ 1). The function uses 64 steps to go from normal to fully faded. You can 
[ control the speed of the fade by passing a non-zero value for DELAY. Each 
[ step is paused by DELAY milliseconds. Passing a value of zero for DELAY will
[ immediately blank the screen to the desired color, with no delay.
[
[ Take care when using fade functions. You should make sure that for each fade 
[ out command, there is a matching fade in command to restore the screen. 
[
[ By default, arguments are passed as numbers. If you want to pass them by 
[ variable, use a numeric value of 1 for BYVAR; the other two arguments in all 
[ commands will then be passed by variable.
[
[ The Power Pack Demo game contains many examples and more detailed 
[ explanations on how the palette functions work.

[ SETMESSAGE FUNCTION
[
[ This function allows you to change the text of a message, setting it to a
[ string value. It also modifies the MenuInput function to update menu text
[ when the assigned messages changes.
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   block(-24, BYVAR, MSGOLD*, STRNEW*);
[
[    * The compiler expects numbers for all arguments so pass messages, strings
[      and variables as numbers, without the 'm', 's' or 'v' prefix
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: Changing message values is an advanced technique
[ that should only be done with extreme care. It is critical that the new value
[ assigned to a message (string STRNEW) is not longer than the original message
[ (MSGOLD) text, or it will over-write the message that follows.
[
[ You should reference messages that you intend to modify by the message number
[ in code, not the text string when writing code, because your compiled code
[ will still think the message is its original value, not the updated value. 
[ This can lead to unexpected results. The Power Pack demo game includes 
[ detailed examples and explanations on how to manage message changes.
[
[ By default, MSGOLD and STRNEW are passed as numbers, i.e. 'm1', 's2'. To pass
[ by variable, use a numeric value of 1 for BYVAR; the other two arguments 
[ will then be passed by variable.
[
[ One of the primary benefits of changing messages is the ability to create 
[ dynamic menus. The menu input function is also modified by this patch so 
[ that any changes to menu messages will be updated the next time the menu is
[ displayed. See the Power Pack demo game for detailed examples of using
[ dynamic menus.

[ PICDRAW FUNCTION
[
[ This function adds the ability to send picture draw commands to the current 
[ picture. The fill function can be changed to use current pixel color as the 
[ target color instead of the default white/red for visual/priority. You can 
[ also clear the entire screen to single visual/priority color value with a
[ single command.
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   to insert picture draw commands:
[   block(-27, FILLSTYLE, sCMDS*, **ANY);
[
[   to clear entire screen:
[   block(-27, -1, vCOLORPAIR*, ANY**);
[
[    * The compiler expects numbers for all arguments so pass the strings and  
[      variables as numbers without the 's'  or 'v' prefix
[
[   ** This argument is ignored, so it can be any value
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The picture-draw function is basically the same 
[ as the overlay.pic function, except you can pass draw commands in a string 
[ instead of a picture resource. Draw commands are passed as a string of 
[ two-digit hex values. The string can include formatting codes, but the 
[ resulting formatted string must not exceed 126 characters. Use multiple 
[ calls if longer drawing operations are needed.
[ 
[ You must include an end of drawing command (hex value FF). 
[
[ If FILLSTYLE is 0, fill operations work as normal, filling only pixels that 
[ are white on the visual screen or red on the priority screen. If FILLSTYLE is
[ one, then fill operations will use colors at the starting fill pixel as the 
[ target color. This lets you fill over areas that are not the default colors 
[ of white/red.
[
[ To clear the screen to a blank visual/priority color, use a value of -1 
[ (255) for the third argument. The command-string argument is ignored and can 
[ be any value. Pass the desired priority/visual color combination as the last 
[ argument. The upper nibble (highest four bits are the priority screen color 
[ and the lower nibble (lowest four bits) are the visual screen color.  
[ Mathematically, COLORPAIR = 16 * PRICOLOR + VISCOLOR.
[
[ The Power Pack Demo game includes some detailed examples of how to use the
[ picdraw function to manipulate pictures.

[ 
[ READ/WRITE TO DATA FILE
[
[ A set of functions that allow you to read and write string data to a data
[ file in your game directory. 
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   [ NEWFILE
[   block(-40, sFILENAME*, vSTART*, vEND*); 
[
[   [ SAVESTRING
[   block(-41, sFILENAME*, vINDEX*, vSTROUT*);
[
[   [ READSTRING
[   block(-42, sFILENAME*, vINDEX*, vSTRIN*);
[
[   [ DELETEFILE
[   block(-43, sFILENAME*, ANY**, ANY**);
[
[    * The compiler expects numbers for all arguments so pass variables as
[      numbers, without the 's' or 'v' prefix
[
[   ** This argument is ignored, so it can be any value
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: Only string data can be saved/restored with 
[ these functions. To create a new data file, use the NEWFILE function. The  
[ filename must be a valid MSDOS (i.e. 8.3 format) filename. The file will be 
[ created in the game directory, unless you also include a directory in 
[ sFILENAME. If the file does not exist, NEWFILE will create it. If the file 
[ already exists, it will be overwritten by the NEWFILE command.
[
[ The range of strings saved to the file are determined by value of vSTART and 
[ vEND. If the END value is less than the START value, no file is created.
[
[ The full allocated space for each string is saved to the file (40 bytes per 
[ string). So the file size is always 40 times the number of strings saved.
[
[ You can update an existing data file with new data using the SAVESTRING 
[ function. Only one string at a time can be written to the file, and its 
[ position in the file is determined by the value of vINDEX. For example, if 
[ index is zero, the first forty bytes of the file will be replaced with the 
[ bytes from the string indicated by the value of vSTROUT. Index values are
[ zero based (first 40 bytes for index 0, second 40 bytes for index 1, etc.)
[
[ If the value of vINDEX is larger than the current size of the file, MSDOS 
[ will automatically expand the file. For example, if the file is 80 bytes 
[ (room for two strings), and index is 4, the file will expand to 200 bytes 
[ and the added string will be the last 40 bytes.
[
[ String data can be read from the file by passing the desired index value and 
[ a destination string value to the READSTRING function. 
[
[ Data files (or any file for that matter) can be deleted using the DELETEFILE
[ function. Be extremely careful though not to delete files by accident. Wild  
[ card characters ('*' and '?'), are not supported.
[
[ For all functions, if there are any file errors (for example, a bad 
[ filename, or trying to write to a read-only file), the operation fails, and 
[ the value of reserved variable v18 (errorParameter) is set to -1 (255). v18 
[ is set to zero if the function succeeds. This allows you to confirm file 
[ operations and take alternate actions if results are not as expected.
[
[ For detailed examples of how to use these file functions, see the AGI Power
[ Pack Demo game.

[ EXTENDED CHARACTER WORDS
[
[ This patch modifies AGI to allow use of extended characters in vocabulary
[ words, and also allows words to start with non-alphabet characters.
[
[ SYNTAX:  n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: This patch allows parsing of words that contain
[ extended characters. This improves support for languages other than English.
[ It also allows words to start with any character, not just 'a' to 'z'. 
[
[ Because of how AGI stores word text data, the patch also requires a special 
[ format in WORDS.TOK for words containing extended characters.
[
[ The format used is to treat character 0x7F as a 'marker'; when that character
[ is encountered, the patch will take the next character and add 128 to it,
[ generating the desired extended character. This means the words are still 
[ compatible with unmodified AGI engines, including modern programs such as 
[ ScummVM and NAGI. The words will just look a little strange and will never
[ match anything a player could type in, but the file will still be 100%
[ compatible with AGI.
[
[ If you are using WinAGI version 2.2.1 or greater, it will automatically do 
[ the formatting for you when you add words to WORDS.TOK.
[
[ The AGI Power Pack demo game uses this patch, and provides detailed 
[ information on how to work with extended character words.
[
[ This patch also fixes a minor coding flaw in AGI's word search function. The 
[ flaw has no impact because there's duplicate code in the function that masks 
[ the error. The function is supposed to return a null pointer when the 
[ starting letter changes (e.g. going from 'a' to 'b'), which should tell the 
[ interpreter that a word match is impossible. But the function checks the 
[ wrong location, so it will never return a null value. It doesn't cause a 
[ problem though, because there is a second check in the function that 
[ identifies the change in start letter and exits the function.

[ ON.OBJECT TEST FUNCTION
[
[ This patch creates a new test command that checks if any part of a screen 
[ object is at a given screen coordinate.
[
[ SYNTAX:
[   posn(oSOBJ, -1, MODE, vX*, vY*)
[
[    * The compiler expects numbers for all arguments so pass variables as
[      numbers, without the 'v' prefix
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: With this function, you pass a set of screen
[ coordinates by variable along with a target screen object and it will return 
[ TRUE if the object is present on the screen at that location. It uses the 
[ posn test command, with -1 as the first coordinate argument. 
[
[ The test uses the height and width; it's not limited to just the object's
[ baseline. If MODE is zero, the test returns TRUE if you click anywhere 
[ within the object's current width/height. If MODE is 1, then it will only
[ return TRUE if you click on a visible pixel - transparent pixels will return
[ FALSE.
[
[ One minor limitation is that if another object is at the same priority value 
[ as the object being tested, and it is in front of the test object, the  
[ function will return TRUE for pixels on the test object that are hidden 
[ behind the other object. To test for overlapping objects would require an 
[ algorithm that essentially rebuilds the entire screen, which is not 
[ practical.
[
[ See the Power Pack Demo game for detailed examples of how to use this 
[ feature.

[ MOVE LOGIC MESSAGES TO NEW MEMORY SEGMENT
[ 
[ Memory management in AGI is based on 16 bit address segments, so there is not
[ much that can be done to make more than 64K bytes available. Most of the data
[ used in AGI relies heavily on everything (resources, DIR files, overlay data)
[ being in the same segment. Message text data is one exception; it turns out 
[ to be relatively easy to move message text data, and redirect functions that 
[ need to access it the new segment.
[
[ SYNTAX: n/a - patch does not modify any command syntax
[
[ LIMITATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS: The extra segment is created when the Power Pack 
[ is first loaded. If the environment does not have enough memory, the Power 
[ Pack will raise an error and exit. (This is not an issue in DOSBox, and on a
[ native MSDOS machine, more than 256K will almost always be plenty.)
[
[ The message text segment is a full 64 Kbytes long, which means it is possible
[ to have very large amounts of text available without impacting the main 
[ memory heap. If you attempt to load resources with messages that exceeds  
[ the 64KB limit, the Power Pack will display an out of memory message and
[ quit.
[
[ When a logic is loaded, it first puts the entire logic in the regular heap
[ and THEN move the messages. This means there must be enough room on the
[ regular heap for the full logic to initially load it- the memory savings 
[ happens after the load.
[
[ Because of the special status of Logic 0, its message text data needs to
[ remain in the main memory segment. You should try to minimize the amount of
[ messages in Logic 0 as much as possible (some basic startup messages, menu
[ text, etc.) Move the rest to logics that are loaded and called as needed to
[ conserve as much memory on the heap as possible.
