3. Parking Lot: Start of game. Car drives in, ego gets out. Ego can only enter building, or get in car (which ends the game.) Every few minutes, another car arrives, patient gets out and enters building. Also, a patient may exit building, get in car and then leave. There should be 4-5 cars in the parking lot at a time. If ego crosses in front of a moving vehicle, he can get run over, ending the game in a loss. If a patient arrives in a batmobile and ego tries to touch it, it shocks and kills him. Touching the trees will get sap on ego's hands, which costs a point; he can wash in the sink in the closet to get the point back. Ego can get back in car; this ends game (winning condition is to have disk with PP source code.)
    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: - couple more small patient views for variety (different color hair/clothes)
    SOUND: car sounds, door sound for entering building, shock sound
    SCORING: -1 for touching trees; +1 for getting run over; +1 for getting shocked by batmobile; +5 for getting in car to end game; +20 if game ends with power pack source disk
    CODING: 'said' statements

4. Lobby: Enter lobby through sliding glass door. There is a receptionist at the desk. One to three patients wait on chairs. Occasionally, one patient will get up, ask receptionist to use bathroom, then exit into hallway. Receptionist will move around, working on computer, tending desk, etc. If ego approaches, receptionist will stop work and speak to ego. If ego asks to use restroom, permission is granted to go into hallway. If ego tries to go into hallway without asking, receptionist will prevent it. Every few minutes, receptionist will tell a patient to go to exam room; patient will exit into hallway. Another patient will enter and take a seat. An old computer magazine (from 1990) is on the table. It contains an article about Sierra and the rumored AGI upgrade, believed to be called the 'Power Pack'. Instead, SCI was released. Hidden in the magazine is code needed to enter the secret room at bottom of stairs. Ego should take the magazine and read it. A cone/placard warns of wet/slippery floor to left of the screen. If ego tries to go past the cone, he slips, falls and dies.

    BACKGROUND: need cone warning of slippery floor (can a puddle be simulated?); posters/pictures on walls (sign next to hallway entrance will provide hint that ego needs permission to get past)
    ANIMATION ART: ego slipping/falling/dying; magazine on table (is a new table needed?); inventory view of magazine;
    SOUND: door open/close; background music
    SCORING: +1 for slipping on wet floor; +5 for asking to use bathroom; +3 for getting magazine; +2 for reading it;
    CODING: 'said' statements

4A. Closeup of magazine: mostly text, will have an article talking about Sierra; with a paragraph or two on the rumored 'Power Pack'; hidden in the text will be the passcode for the control room entry door.
    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: n/a
    SOUND: n/a
    SCORING: n/a
    CODING: done

5. Hallway: Four doors- a restroom (will never open; it's always 'occupied'), a doctor's office (never opens, doctor is always out), and an exam room (will open, but ego interrupts an exam, and the nurse will slam door shut). Repeated attempts to enter exam room will get ego thrown out of building, and game will end in a loss. Last door is a janitor closet. Ego can go through that door to enter the hallway.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: done
    SOUND: open/close doors; knock on doors; getting arrested music (borrow from GR/PQ)
    SCORING: +1 for getting arrested; +1 for opening closet door
    CODING: 'said' statements

4. Closet: Full of 'janitor' stuff. When ego moves far enough into room, he trips over a broom. (If go tries to pick up broom, that also starts the tripping sequence.) Tripping results in ego causing wall to collapse, revealing a hole to another room. The sink faucet has a slight drip; ego can fix it to get extra points. If broom is left on floor, ego will trip again (but not actually fall over) at random time intervals. Ego can put broom in corner to get extra points. Touching the plunger will subtract points. Ego can wash hands in sink to recover lost points.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: hand washing animation (ego walks to sink, back turned to player; should be very simple)
    SOUND: open/close door; tripping/falling/breaking wall; water drip; 
    SCORING: +3 for closing closet door; +5 for making hole in wall; -1 each time for tripping over broom after hole is made; +2 for putting broom in corner; -3 for touching plunger; +1/+3 for washing hands after touching tree/plunger; +3 pts for fixing drip
    CODING: 'said' statements, wash hands 

5. Secret Room: Connects the closet to the stairway. No other purpose/action for this room.
 
    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: done
    SOUND: done
    SCORING: light flicker/buzz
    CODING: 'said' statements

6. Stairway: At bottom of stairs is a door to the PP Control Room. The door is locked with a keypad code needed to enter. The code can be found in the magazine article. To open the door, a close up picture/room is used to enter the code. Correct code will open door. There are lights along the stairway. One of them flickers every few seconds.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: done
    SOUND: open/close door; light flicker(?)
    SCORING: n/a
    CODING: 'said' statements

6A. Closeup of keypad for entering code: The keypad is a standard 12 button keypad; 0-9, plus clear/enter buttons. Correct code will open door, scoring points. If wrong code entered too many times, lose a point, kick player back to room and make them wait a minute.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: done
    SOUND: tone/beep when buttons pressed; click when door unlocked; buzzer when wrong code entered
    SCORING: +6 points when correct code entered; -1 when wrong code is entered three times in a row
    CODING: add actual combo number

7. Control Room: The AGI Power Pack Control Room has a large console in the middle of room. Two exits, to right and left lead to an office, and a store room, respectively. The console consists of a central terminal (keyboard and monitor, with disk drive), and six panels:
    -mouse cursor panel
    -sound mode panel
    -custom FM instrument panel
    -custom message box color panel
    -animation speed panel
    -color palette panel
    -[optional 'paint' panel; uses power pack features to simulate a typical draw/paint program]

When ego enters from the stairwell, the control panel fails (maybe flash screen or something), door slams shut and won't open. Terminal is only part of panel working. It's a unix-like system (SINUX or some other acronym). Most commands don't work; there's memory corruption. Ego has to reboot/restart system to get it working correctly. Once rebooted, the six control panels and the security system (BaDASS - Building and Digital Access Security System) need passwords to be restarted. BaDASS can only be restarted when all other control panels are restarted. Each system/panel needs a password; they can be found among things in the office and store room. 
Once all passwords are entered, and BaDASS is restarted, door will unlock; ego can leave, going back to car in parking lot to end the game. Ego needs to copy the PP source code to a floppy disk in order to get max points. 

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: done 
    SOUND: system failure sound effect;
    SCORING: +5 pts for each module successfully restored (30 pts total); +10 pts for restoring BaDASS; +6 for copying source files to floppy (-4 for forgetting to get disk)
    CODING: 'said' statements

8. Office: The PP operator's office. A desk with non-working computer/printer. On the printer is a printed memo that contains the code to the mouse control panel. In a desk drawer is a paper with series of passwords (Compuserve, AOL, etc; also one with combo for safe.) In other desk drawer is an original Sony Walkman (audio cassette player), but no tape in it. On the wall is a picture; behind it is a safe (clue on password list should lead ego to look behind picture). In the safe, there is a coded password to the BaDASS. In a filing cabinet there is a box of floppy disks. Ego needs to take one in order to copy the PP source files from the terminal. There is also a notebook with a coded password to the mouse cursor panel. There is a rug in the room; underneath it is a folder that has a coded password for the sound mode panel.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: memo on printer item view; password list item view; picture to hide safe; floppy disk item view; folder item view; notebook item view; 
    SOUND: tbd (drawer opening; safe open/close; picture swinging?) 
    SCORING: 3 pts for getting memo from printer; 3 pts for getting password list; 2 pts for getting walkman; 2 pts for finding safe; 3 pts for getting BadASS code; 2 pts for getting floppy disk; 3 pts for getting notebook; 2 pts moving rug; 3 pts for getting folder with sound password
    CODING: 'said' statements

8A. Safe door closeup: spinning combo lock dial.Enter correct combination to open.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION ART: dial numbers, dial center, handle 
    SOUND: 'click' for dial spin; unlock sound 
    SCORING: 3 pts for opening safe
    CODING: done

9. Storage Room: A room full of props that inspired various Sierra games. On bottom of head pillow in coffin is coded password to color palette panel. On top of PQ podium is a sheet listing possible PQ sequels, and a coded password to animation speed panel. In the treasure chest, there is a scroll that has coded password for msgbox panel (scroll has a recipe on it with code hidden in recipe text). In cabinet by robots is music sheet with coded password to FM instrument panel. Clock will be synched with player's current time. In green PQ cabinet are some old cassettes; only one of interest is 80s mix tape. Ego can put it in Walkman to play some background music. If ego climbs in the coffin, lid slams shut and he dies there.

    BACKGROUND: done
    ANIMATION art: closeup of pillow; closeup of podium showing page with password 
    SOUND: 80s mix tape music, coffin open/close
    SCORING: 3 pts for finding pillow code; 3 pts for finding podium code; 1 pt for opening treasure chest; 3 pts for getting scroll from chest; 3 pts for getting music sheet; 4 pts for getting mix tape; 4 pts for playing mix tape in walkman
    CODING: 'said' statements 

Control Panel Rooms: If visited before enabled, a grayed out (unpowered) version is shown, with no ability to interact. Once enabled, the panels are available. Usage info is available on main console using typical 'help file' command. Changes made by ego will be applied globally for rest of game.
