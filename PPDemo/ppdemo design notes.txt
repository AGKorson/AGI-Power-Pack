PP Demo Design notes/Walk-through
-----------------------------

X = item done
I = item in progress
O = item not started


0. Intro/Opening Credits: TBD
    O-background picture
    O-theme music
    O-views for rolling credits? for other intro animations?

    I-Toolbar and statusbar
    O-menu - what custom menu items are needed?

1. Parking Lot: Start of game. Car drives in, ego gets out. Ego can only enter building, or get in car (which ends the game.) Every few minutes, another car arrives, patient gets out and enters building. Also, a patient may exit building, get in car and then leave. There should be 4-5 cars in the parking lot at a time. If ego crosses in front of a moving vehicle, he can get run over, ending the game in a loss.

Art/Sound:
    X-background picture (need some bushes/trees on edge to provide cover for vehicles entering/exiting)
    X-cars (make sure enough different styles/colors)
    I-small sized patients (several different versions) 
    X-view of ego getting run over
    O-view of ego getting stunned by bat-mobile security
    O-car sound effects
    O-game winning/end credits music
    O-end credits views/pictures?

Coding:
    I-opening sequence
    I-end game sequence
    O-look statements

2. Lobby: Enter lobby through sliding glass door. There is a receptionist at the desk. Three patients wait on chairs. Occasionally, one patient will get up, ask receptionist to use bathroom, then exit into hallway. Receptionist will move around, working on computer, tending desk, etc. If ego approaches, receptionist will stop work and speak to ego. If ego asks to use restroom, permission is granted to go into hallway. If ego tries to go into hallway without asking, receptionist will prevent it. Every few minutes, receptionist will call a patient to desk and tell them to go to exam room; patient will exit into hallway. Another patient will enter and take a seat. An old computer magazine (from 1990) is on the table. It contains an article about Sierra and the rumored AGI upgrade, believed to be called the 'Power Pack'. Instead, SCI was released. Hidden in the magazine is code needed to enter the secret room at bottom of stairs. Ego should take the magazine and read it.

    O-4-5 different patients (maybe same/similar views, but different hair styles, clothe colors, etc) including sitting/reading/waiting views, sitting/rising views, walking views
    O-magazine view (on screen, inventory item)
    O-close up magazine picture (including article text, maybe a inset photo)
    O-sliding door sound effect
    O-background music (typical 'elevator music' appropriate for a waiting area)

3. Hallway: Four doors- a restroom (will never open; it's always 'occupied'), a doctor's office (never opens, doctor is always out), and an exam room (will open, but ego interrupts an exam, and the nurse will slam door shut). Repeated attempts to enter exam room will get ego thrown out of building, and game will end in a loss.
Last door is a janitor closet. Ego can go through that door to enter the hallway.

4. Closet: Full of 'janitor' stuff. When ego moves far enough into room, he trips over a broom. (If go tries to pick up broom, that also starts the tripping sequence.) Tripping results in ego causing wall to collapse, revealing a hole to another room. The sink faucet has a slight drip; ego can fix it to get extra points. If broom is left on floor, ego will trip again (but not actually fall over) at random time intervals. Ego can put broom in corner to get extra points.

5. Secret Room: Connects the closet to the stairway. No other purpose/action for this room.

6. Stairway: At bottom of stairs is a door to the PP Control Room. The door is locked with a keypad code needed to enter. The code can be found in the magazine article. To open the door, a close up picture/room is used to enter the code. Correct code will open door. There are lights along the stairway. One of them flickers every few seconds.

6A. Closeup of keypad for entering code: The keypad is a standard 12 button keypad; 0-9, plus clear/enter buttons.

    O-button sound effect

7. Control Room: The AGI Power Pack Control Room has a large console in the middle of room. Two exits, to right and left lead to an office, and a store room, respectively. The console consists of a central terminal (keyboard and monitor, with disk drive), and six panels:
        -mouse cursor panel
        -sound mode panel
    -custom FM instrument panel
        -custom message box color panel
        -animation speed panel
        -color palette panel
        -[optional 'paint' panel; uses power pack features to simulate a typical draw/paint program]

When ego enters from the stairwell, the control panel fails (maybe flash screen or something), door slams shut and won't open. Terminal is only part of panel working. It's a unix-like system (SINUX or some other acronym). Most commands don't work; there's memory corruption. Ego has to reboot/restart system to get it working correctly. Once rebooted, the six control panels and the security system (BaDASS - Building and Digital Access Security System) need passwords to be restarted. BaDASS can only be restarted when all other control panels are restarted. Each system/panel needs a password; they can be found among things in the office and store room. 
Once all passwords are entered, and BaDASS is restarted, door will unlock; ego can leave, going back to car in parking lot to end the game. Ego needs to copy the PP source code to a floppy disk in order to get max points.

8. Office: The PP operator's office. A desk with non-working computer/printer. On the printer is a printed memo that contains the code to the mouse control panel. In a desk drawer is a paper with series of passwords (Compuserve, AOL, etc; also one with combo for safe.) In other desk drawer is an original Sony Walkman (audio cassette player), but no tape in it. On the wall is a picture; behind it is a safe (clue on password list should lead ego to look behind picture). In the safe, there is a coded password to the BaDASS. In a filing cabinet there is a box of floppy disks. Ego needs to take one in order to copy the PP source files from the terminal. There is also a notebook with a coded password to the mouse cursor panel. There is a rug in the room; underneath it is a folder that has a coded password for the sound mode panel.

9. Supply Room: A room full of props that inspired various Sierra games. On bottom of head pillow in coffin is coded password to color palette panel. Scratched into top of PQ podium is coded password to animation speed panel. In the treasure chest, there is a scroll that has coded password for msgbox panel (scroll has a recipe on it with code hidden in recipe text). In cabinet by robots is music sheet with coded password to FM instrument panel. Clock will be synched with player's current time. In green PQ cabinet are some old cassettes; only one of interest is 80s mix tape. Ego can put it in walkman to play some background music.

10: Control Panel Rooms: If visited before enabled, a grayed out (unpowered) version is shown, with no ability to interact. Once enabled, the panels are available. Usage info is available on main console using typical 'help file' command. Changes made by ego will be applied globally for rest of game.
