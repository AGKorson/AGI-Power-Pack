3. Parking Lot: Start of game. Car drives in, Drew gets out. Drew can only enter building, or get in car (which ends the game.) Every few minutes, another car arrives, patient gets out and enters building. Also, a patient may exit building, get in car and then leave. There should be 4-5 cars in the parking lot at a time. If Drew crosses in front of a moving vehicle, he can get run over, ending the game in a loss. If a patient arrives in a batmobile and Drew tries to touch it, it shocks and kills him. Touching the trees will get sap on Drew's hands, which costs a point; he can wash in the sink in the closet to get the point back. Drew can get back in car; this ends game (winning condition is to have disk with PP source code.)

4. Lobby: Enter lobby through sliding glass door. There is a receptionist at the desk. One to three patients wait on chairs. Occasionally, one patient will get up, ask receptionist to use bathroom, then exit into hallway. Receptionist will move around, working on computer, tending desk, etc. If Drew approaches, receptionist will stop work and speak to him. If Drew asks to use restroom, permission is granted to go into hallway. If Drew tries to go into hallway without asking, receptionist will prevent it. Every few minutes, receptionist will tell a patient to go to exam room; patient will exit into hallway. Another patient will enter and take a seat. An old computer magazine (from 1990) is on the table. It contains an article about Sierra and the rumored AGI upgrade, believed to be called the 'Power Pack'. Instead, SCI was released. Hidden in the magazine is code needed to enter the secret room at bottom of stairs. Drew should take the magazine and read it. A cone/placard warns of wet/slippery floor to left of the screen. If Drew tries to go past the cone, he slips, falls and dies.

5. Hallway: Four doors- a restroom (will never open; it's always 'occupied'), a doctor's office (never opens, doctor is always out), and an exam room (will open, but Drew interrupts an exam, and the nurse will slam door shut). Repeated attempts to enter exam room will get Drew thrown out of building, and game will end in a loss. Last door is a janitor closet. Drew can go through that door to enter the hallway. Failing to close the door while going further into the 'hidden' area will result in getting trapped (i.e. lose game).

    SCORING: +1 for getting arrested; +1 for opening closet door
    CODING: done

6. Closet: Full of 'janitor' stuff. When Drew moves far enough into room, he trips over a broom. (If he tries to pick up broom, that also starts the tripping sequence.) Tripping results in Drew causing wall to collapse, revealing a hole to another room. The sink faucet has a slight drip; Drew can fix it to get extra points. If broom is left on floor, Drew will trip again (but not actually fall over) at random time intervals. Drew can put broom in corner to get extra points. Touching the plunger will subtract points. Drew can wash hands in sink to recover lost points.

    SCORING: +3 for closing closet door; +5 for making hole in wall; -1 each time for tripping over broom after hole is made; +2 for putting broom in corner; -3 for touching plunger; +1 first time washing hands; +1/+3 for washing hands after touching tree/plunger; +3 pts for fixing drip

8. Stairway: At bottom of stairs is a door to the PP Control Room. The door is locked with a keypad code needed to enter. The code can be found in the magazine article. To open the door, a close up picture/room is used to enter the code. Correct code will open door. There are lights along the stairway. One of them flickers every few seconds.

8A. Closeup of keypad for entering code: The keypad is a standard 12 button keypad; 0-9, plus clear/enter buttons. Correct code will open door, scoring points. If wrong code entered too many times, lose a point, kick player back to room and make them wait a minute.

9. Control Room: The AGI Power Pack Control Room has a large console in the middle of room. Two exits, to right and left lead to an office, and a store room, respectively. The console consists of a central terminal (keyboard and monitor, with disk drive), and six panels:
    -mouse cursor panel
    -sound mode panel
    -custom FM instrument panel
    -custom message box color panel
    -animation speed panel
    -color palette panel

When Drew enters from the stairwell, the control panel fails (flash screen, sound effects), door slams shut and won't open. Terminal is only part of panel working. It's a DOS-like system. Most commands don't work; there's memory corruption. Drew has to reboot/restart system to get it working correctly. Once rebooted, the six control panels and the security system (BaDASS - Building and Digital Access Security System) need passwords to be restarted. The passwords can be found among things in the office and store room. Once BaDASS is restarted, door will unlock; Drew can leave, going back to car in parking lot to end the game. Drew needs to copy the PP source code to a floppy disk in order to 'win'.

    SOUND: done
    SCORING: +5 pts for each module successfully restored (30 pts total); +10 pts for restoring BaDASS; 4 pts for inserting drive; +6 for copying source files to floppy
    CODING: done

10. Office: The PP operator's office. A desk with non-working computer/printer. On the printer is a printed memo that contains hint to accessing the terminal (userID and password info). In a desk drawer is a paper with series of passwords (Compuserve, gym locker, etc; also one with combo for safe.) In other desk drawer is an original Sony Walkman (audio cassette player), but no tape in it. On the wall is a picture; behind it is a safe (clue on password list should lead Drew to look behind picture). In the safe, there is a manual with password to the BaDASS. In a filing cabinet there is a box of floppy disks. Drew needs to take one in order to copy the PP source files from the terminal. There is also a notebook with a coded password to the mouse cursor panel. There is a rug in the room; underneath it is a folder that has a coded password for the sound mode panel.

11. Storage Room: A room full of props that inspired various Sierra games. On bottom of head pillow in coffin is coded password to color palette panel. On top of PQ podium is a sheet listing possible PQ sequels, and a coded password to animation speed panel. In the treasure chest, there is a scroll that has coded password for msgbox panel (scroll has a recipe on it with code hidden in recipe text). In cabinet by robots is music sheet with coded password to FM instrument panel. Clock will be synched with player's current time. In green PQ cabinet are some old cassettes; only one of interest is 80s mix tape. Drew can put it in Walkman to play some background music. If Drew climbs in the coffin, lid slams shut and he dies there.
