# AGI-Power-Pack
A demonstration game that highlights all the features available in the AGI Power Pack modifications.

The AGI Power Pack is an AGI logic script code block that takes advantage of a bug in AGI's set.string command that allows modification of the program's executable code (basically a buffer overflow hack). The Power Pack leverages this to inject new assembly routines that significantly extend the capabilities of AGI. Since all of the code necessary to do this is contained entirely within the Power Pack logic code, it requires no modification to the AGI program files, and will run on any MSDOS version 2 or 3 interpreter. 
The Power Pack will only work with the MSDOS interpreter files. It will not work with any other platform, nor will it work with any modern interpreters such as NAGI or SCUMMVM.
